// forever. The cheap profile is bound to the WAKE CLASS, not to any issue field: an issue holding an
// `activeRecoveryAction` is woken with `wakePolicy.reason: source_scoped_recovery_action`, and that
// class dispatches status-only runs by construction. Since only a recorded disposition clears the
// recovery action, "wait for a normal-model run on this issue" is unreachable by construction.
//
// BLO-25878 measured the cost: three consecutive runs on the BLO-8207 credential chain each
// assembled a complete board-ordered approval payload, each was refused, and each read this flag as
// a retry that would arrive. None did. State the reachable exits instead of implying an unreachable
// one — the caller can always take one of them in the run that is refused.

/**
 * BLO-32566. The stranded-recovery wake sites pick their work class at runtime
 * rather than passing a literal: a status-only wake cannot write an issue
 * document, so once the newest run on the issue has been refused exactly that
 * write, re-dispatching status-only guarantees the same 403 and the issue can
 * never self-heal (only a recorded disposition clears the recovery action, and
 * while it is active every wake on the issue is status-only).
 *
 * A named boolean helper rather than a fourth `withRecoveryModelProfileHint`
 * overload accepting the union: the overloads exist so each work class gets a
 * precise return type, and a union-accepting overload would hand every caller a
 * union return in exchange for a widened public API on a *cost guard*. Branching
 * here keeps each arm resolving against its own precise overload, and keeps the
 * escalation rule stated in one place instead of at six call sites.
 *
 * `planning_only` is the minimum escalation that clears the trap — normal model
 * with `allowDocumentUpdates: true`, while deliverable and annotation writes stay
 * barred. It is the same escalation BLO-23197 chose for the successful-run-handoff
 * lane, which deliberately scoped this lane out as follow-up.
